                myFlix is an informational web app for movies, directors, genres
                and more. It was developed using MongoDB, Express, React and
                Node. The website allows users to create a profile, edit their
                profile, and save their favorite movies.

                myFlix is a self-made project with the purpose to practice
                designing a full-stack web app from start to finish using the
                MERN tech stack. By building every aspect of the website by
                myself, I am able to understand how all the separate parts
                function together.

                The main goal was to develop a full-stack website to improve my
                understanding of how web apps are structured from frontend to
                backend and to familiarize myself with the MERN tech stack. In
                addition, I wanted to have a project to show on my portfolio to
                prove to prospective clients that I can develop a full-stack web
                application.

                <h3>Backend - MongoDB, Express, Node</h3>
                The first step was to create an API for storing data about
                movies in a MongoDB database. By using Express, I created
                multiple HTTP endpoints for manipulating or querying data from
                the database through CRUD operations while also using middleware
                for HTTP authentication, JWT authentication, password
                encryption, data validation, etc. Testing was performed using
                Postman.

              <div>
                <h3>Frontend - React </h3>
                Once the API was finished, I developed the client-side of the
                web app by using React and Bootstrap to create a single page
                application with the react-router controlling what is displayed.
                Elements are created through imported Bootstrap components and
                styling is controlled by preset classes.
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                It took some time getting used to the Bootstrap components and
                styling using classes, but by carefully looking through the
                Bootstrap Docs I could figure it out. In addition, adding the
                middleware to the API was difficult, but by reviewing each
                section of code separately and with some help from my mentor, I
                was able to integrate it successfully.

                files. By using resources like cloud storage, development time

                using React Native. The messages were stored on Google Firebase
                and saved locally when possible. Through the Gifted Chat
                library, the messages were displayed using text bubbles within a
                shared chat box. Custom actions were created to be able to share
                audio messages, images, and locations with other users. Styling
                was done through the use of StyleSheets within React Native.
                Testing was performed through Android Studio emulating mobiles
                devices and Expo for hosting the application over Wi-Fi.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                The main challenge was learning the syntax for React Native and
                which built-in component could be used such as Views,
                TouchableOpacity, etc. In addition, integrating the Gifted Chat
                library and Expo library was difficult due to how specific the
                components needed to be organized, especially when adding audio
                message functionality. By consulting the Gifted Chat Github and
                Expo documentation, I was able to find a solution.

                In order to simplify the back-end processes, I used Firebase
                Cloud Functions to save time in development. Cloud functions are
                also becoming very popular among developers to remove the need
                to develop their backend from scratch. By using cloud functions,
                HTTP requests containing a total amount could be made to the
                Stripe API which returns a client secret. The client secret is
                sent to Stripe along with the user's credit card information to
                complete the payment.

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                Spoiler Alert is an informational web app for users to search
                for movie plots. It was developed using React, TMDB API, and
                Wikipedia API.

                <h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
                Spoiler Alert is a self-made project with the purpose of
                understanding the process of making API calls and manipulating
                the data returned. It improved my ability to read and filter
                through API documentation. In addition, I learned how to clean
                the data received by using RegEx (regular expressions).

                <h3>Objective</h3>
                The main goal was to develop a website to improve my
                understanding of how APIs function. In addition, I wanted to
                have a project to show on my portfolio showing my ability to
                read documentation and to learn how to integrate new
                technologies or resources into my apps.

                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <h3>Frontend - React</h3>
                The client-side of the web app by using React and Material UI
                icons to create a minimalistic design. A simple search bar is
                used to call the TMDB API to return a list of movies along with
                their matching movie poster image. By selecting a movie, an API
                request is made to the Wikipedia API using search queries and
                the plot is returned.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                Retrieving data from the Wikipedia API was somewhat difficult
                and required multiple chained queries to isolate the plot
                section. By carefully reviewing the Wikipedia API documentation,
                I was able to filter the relevant Wikipedia entries and their
                respective plots. The movie plot unfortunately contained element
                tags and styling so RegEx was used to remove any unnecessary
                text. Due to unfamiliarity with RegEx, I used StackOverflow
                posts to find a solution.

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                The development took around 2 months to complete. Originally,
                the web app was only supposed to retrieve a list of movies using
                the TMDB API, but I had an idea to expand the web app to also
                retrieve the movieâ€™s plot, to appeal to users who like to read
                about movies instead of watching them.
